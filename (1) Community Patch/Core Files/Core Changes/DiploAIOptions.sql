-- Advanced Diplomacy AI Options
-- All of these options (except Limit Victory Pursuit Randomization and Disable Flavor Randomization) are savegame compatible.
-- This means that enabling/disabling them and then loading a saved game will activate/deactivate them with no issues.

-- [LIMIT VICTORY PURSUIT RANDOMIZATION]
-- If set to 1, the AI will always select the Primary Victory Pursuit that it receives a hint for in XML. If Random Personalities is enabled, it will use the hint of the leader it's acting as.
-- If there isn't a Primary Victory Pursuit hint defined in XML, or if the Primary Victory Pursuit hint is for a disabled victory condition, one will be selected randomly.
-- If set to 2, the AI will ALSO avoid selecting a Secondary Victory Pursuit unless one has been defined in XML.
-- If set to 3, all AI players will also *ALWAYS* choose their Primary Victory Pursuit hint as their Current Victory Pursuit. If the victory condition is disabled but the secondary pursuit is valid, it will use that one instead.
-- NOTE 1: Options 1 and 2 only increase the likelihood that the AI will go for that pursuit (and modify diplo AI behavior in favor of that). Option 3 guarantees it, but forbids the AI from adapting to circumstances.
-- NOTE 2: Option 3 also ignores the Random Personalities game option.
-- NOTE 3: For Option 3, Domination Victory will be attempted if it is possible for the AI to eliminate all other major civs, ignoring whether or not Domination Victory is enabled in game options.

-- [ENABLE NUCLEAR GANDHI]
-- If set to 1, Gandhi (if he has nukes, and Random Personalities isn't enabled) will do what he's best known for in the Civilization series. ;)
-- If set to 2, he'll do it even if Random Personalities is enabled.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_ENABLE_NUCLEAR_GANDHI', '1';

-- [DISABLE WAR BRIBES]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations are unable to bribe other AI civilizations into declaring war, but they can still bribe (and be bribed) by humans.
-- If set to 2, the option to bribe another AI civilization into declaring war on a third party is removed globally.
-- War bribes between human players are unaffected by this setting.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_DISABLE_WAR_BRIBES', '0';

-- [DISABLE CITY TRADING]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations are unable to trade cities with other AIs, but can still trade cities with human players.

INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_DISABLE_CITY_TRADING', '0';

-- [DISABLE INSULT MESSAGES]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations will not send threats/insults such as "you're a warmonger" or "you're getting too friendly with our City-State friends" to human players.
-- Note that these messages provide a chance to provoke the AI into declaring war. Disabling them removes this chance.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_DISABLE_INSULT_MESSAGES', '0';

-- [DISABLE COMPLIMENT MESSAGES]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations will not send friendly compliments such as "FYI, we befriended your friend" to human players.

-- [NO FAKE OPINION MODIFIERS]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations are unable to fake having no disputes by displaying false modifiers in the opinion table (i.e. no contested borders, no competition with City-States, etc.).
-- Does not prevent the AI from concealing their true Approach (i.e. pretending to be FRIENDLY or displaying "They desire friendly relations with our empire").

INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)

SELECT 'DIPLOAI_SHOW_HIDDEN_OPINION_MODIFIERS', '0';

-- [SHOW ALL OPINION VALUES]
-- If set to 1, AI opinion modifiers will have their number values displayed, so you can see how much a factor is affecting your relationship.
-- Unlike Transparent Diplomacy, the AI can still choose to hide Opinion modifiers from the player.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_SHOW_ALL_OPINION_VALUES', '0';

-- [SHOW BASE HUMAN OPINION]
-- If set to 1, a modifier explaining the AI's instinctive like/dislike of human players will be displayed in their table of opinion modifiers.
-- This value is otherwise hidden unless Debug Mode is enabled due to being immersion-breaking.
-- Only does anything if AI Opinion score towards humans has been modified via HumanOpinionChange in DifficultyMod.xml.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_SHOW_BASE_HUMAN_OPINION', '0';

INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)

-- [ENABLE TEMPORARY FOR PERMANENT TRADING]
-- If set to 0, humans cannot trade temporary items (gold per turn, resources, etcetera) for permanent items (lump sum gold, cities, etcetera) with AI players.
-- If set to 1 (default), AI players can trade their temporary items for the human's permanent items, but not vice versa.
-- If set to 2, there are no restrictions on trading temporary items for permanent items.
-- Option 2 is exploitable, so enabling this option reduces the difficulty if you take advantage of it!
-- Human-to-human trades, trades with "Permanent Peace" or "Permanent War or Peace" enabled, and trades between teammates are always unrestricted.

SELECT 'DIPLOAI_TEMPORARY_FOR_PERMANENT_TRADING_SETTING', '0';
