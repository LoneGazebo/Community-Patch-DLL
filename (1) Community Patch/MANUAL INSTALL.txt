If you downloaded this mod manually on its own, just stick it in your MODS folder and it should function correctly, with one exception.

To fix the BNW bug where Cape Town uses Almaty's audio clip upon selection, some extra steps are needed:
1. Move the MinorCivSounds_CommunityPatch.xml file in the repository's main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2\Sounds\XML.
2. Then, you need to rename it to MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml.
NOTE: You can instead move the MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml file in the main directory to the same location. Unless you're using a modmod which adds any of the same entries to MinorCivsSounds, this will work.
3. You will also need to move the Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg file in the main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2.
4. Delete the existing Expansion2.Civ5Pkg file in that directory, and then rename Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg to Expansion2.Civ5Pkg.

Note that Community Patch Only isn't compatible with EUI.

If you downloaded this mod manually and you are also playing with the full (2) Vox Populi mod, see INSTRUCTIONS.txt in (2) Vox Populi for instructions on how to do a correct installation.
