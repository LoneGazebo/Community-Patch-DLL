SET Text = 'According to legend, Kyiv was founded by three Slavic brothers - Kyi, Schek, and Khoryv - around the beginning of the 6th Century AD. Since then, Kyiv, one of the oldest cities in Eastern Europe, has passed through times of great prominence and periods of relative obscurity. Throughout the centuries, however, it has remained the most important Slavic cultural center, playing a pivotal role in the development of the medieval East Slavic civilization.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Located on the Dnieper trade route between Constantinople and Scandinavia, Kyiv came under the control of local Varangian (Viking) nobility and became the nucleus of the state of Rus. During the 1000s, it reached its ascendancy, a cultural hub with over 400 churches, eight markets, docks and a caravansary, and magnificent homes. With the founding of the Kyiv-Mogilyanskaya Academy in 1632, the city became the center of Ukrainian learning and scholarship. But as the capital of Kyivan Rus, the city was repeatedly sacked and occupied.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1667 the city became part of the Russian Empire; Kyiv remained an ecclesiastical and cultural center, but its political and economic influence was marginalized. Kyiv experienced growing "Russification" in the 1800s, as a result of Russian migration, educational policies, and industrialization. However, enthusiasts among ethnic Ukrainian nobles, military officers and merchants kept the native culture alive in Kyiv, often through clandestine activities such as book-printing, amateur theater, private soirees, folk festivals and the like.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Forcefully incorporated into the Soviet Union, the city weathered all manner of troubles: the famine of 1932-1933 devastated the lower classes, Stalin''s 1937-1938 purges almost obliterated the city''s intelligensia, and the 1941-1943 Nazi invasion brought death and destruction. But Kyiv survived, and in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union an independent Ukraine was proclaimed in 1991, with resurgent Kyiv as its capital and cultural heart.'

-- Update Hong Kong's Civilopedia entry to reflect increased Chinese control in 2020 onwards
UPDATE Language_en_US
SET Text = 'A city-state in its truest form, Hong Kong is a massive city residing along the southern coast of China. Home to more than seven million residents in the present-day, the island of Hong Kong and its surrounding territories were once home to numerous small settlements, including those constructed by foreign explorers. During the reign of the Chinese Qing Dynasty in the 19th century, trade relations with England dissolved amidst growing concern over the importation of Indian Opium into China. Britain had hoped to offset its increasing expensive tea imports from China by exporting greater amounts of Opium from its Indian colonies to China. However, the Qing rulers objected, and attempted to seize incoming opium shipments, inciting the First Opium War in 1839.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As one of the premier naval powers of the era, Britain had little trouble defeating the Chinese forces and occupying the island of Hong Kong. After nearly 3 years of conflict, the signing of the Treaty of Nanking in 1842 provided Britain with various spoils, including control of Hong Kong. After growing as a British colony for more than 150 years, Hong Kong was finally returned to China in 1997, after a peaceful transfer of power led to the creation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. For years, Hong Kong maintained a high degree of autonomy under the "one country, two systems" framework, supporting a separate legal and economic system rooted in free trade. However, in the early 21st century, Beijing asserted greater control over the region, prompting political changes and widespread international concern over the erosion of Hong Kong''s autonomy. Despite these shifts, Hong Kong remains a global financial center, distinguished by its highly dense urban landscape, distinctive skyline, and vibrant cultural identity.'

-- Update Singapore's Civilopedia entry to note that it's now the fourth wealthiest country by GDP per capita, not the fifth

SET Text = 'Records and archeological excavations show that the island of modern-day Singapore has been occupied from about the second century AD - the small island was originally part of the Sumatran Empire and went by the name of Temasek, or "sea town." For unknown reasons the area slid into a decline in the 14th century, and for the next few centuries the island''s population consisted mostly of small villages of fishermen.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]This all changed on January 29, 1819, when the British statesman Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles landed on the island and signed a treaty to develop the southern portion into a British trading post. Singapore officially became a British colony in 1824 when the British East India Company gained control of the entire island. The island city grew steadily as it became an important hub for trade and commerce in the Pacific.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1941, the Japanese invaded Singapore and in six short days gained control of the city and its military base. The Battle of Singapore, as it came to be known, was the worst recorded military disaster in British history and the city became an important base for the Japanese for the rest of World War II. The British regained control of the island a month after Japan''s surrender in 1945.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the war, Singapore started on the road to independence. In 1955 the city was allowed to hold its first general election, but delegations sent to England demanding self-rule were met with resistance until 1959. Four years later the small city-state nation declared formal independence from the British Empire and quickly joined the Federation of Malaysia. However, major ideological conflicts between Singapore and the Federation soured the relationship and two years later Singapore officially declared complete sovereignty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Since its independence, fortunes for the city-state have increased, with massive improvements in standards of living, the economy, and education. Singapore is now the fourth wealthiest country in the world (in terms of GDP per capita) with booming tourism and medical industries.'
