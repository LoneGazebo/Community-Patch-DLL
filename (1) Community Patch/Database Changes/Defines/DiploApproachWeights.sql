-- Direct +/- and % weights to approach scores have been moved to DifficultyTables.xml (Community Patch) and DifficultyMod.xml (Vox Populi).

-- Target Value Multipliers to Approach Weights
-- WAR and HOSTILE approach scores are multiplied by whichever of these values is appropriate, and then divided by 100.
-- NOTE: Target Value is also affected by proximity!

-- Neutral Default Weight
-- Adds x times the AI's Neutral Bias to the Neutral approach

-- Bias for Current Approach
-- Adds x times the bias for the AI's current approach to that approach's score
-- Used to make the AI less likely to switch approaches randomly. Not applied during a reevaluation!

-- Current War Bias

-- Approach Shift Rate
-- The rate at which AI approach scores shift from turn to turn. Valid values are between 0.01 and 1.00, default value is 0.30. Higher values make the AI more responsive to changing circumstances, while lower values make AI behavior more consistent.
-- It should be noted that regardless of the value here, there are many triggers (such as a war declaration) which cause the AI to instantly reevaluate its current approach scores, assigning those as the new ones immediately.
	('APPROACH_SHIFT_PERCENT', 0.30),

-- Approach Randomness
-- If set to a non-zero value, multiplies the weight for each *major civ* approach by (100 +/- n%), where n is a random number between 0 and APPROACH_RANDOM_PERCENT, then divides by 100.
-- Default value is 5. Valid values are between 0 and 100. Higher values make the AI more erratic.
-- This value is doubled if the Random Personalities game option is active.

-- Approach Trade Value Modifiers
-- Change the AI's trade prices based on their surface approach towards another player.
-- WAR is possible as a surface approach, but the trade modifier for peace deals is always 100 for sanity, so there's no define for it.
