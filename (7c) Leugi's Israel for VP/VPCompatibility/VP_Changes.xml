			<Text>The First Temple in Jerusalem, also known as Beit HaMikdash or Solomon's Temple, was the first of a series of structures that were located on the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem. These successive temples functioned as the main site of ancient Israelite and later Jewish worship. According to the Hebrew Book of Kings, the First Temple was built in 957 BCE by King Solomon (reigned c. 970-c. 930 BCE), who proclaimed the Temple as the sole place for Jewish sacrifice, replacing the portable Tabernacle as well as local sanctuaries and altars. King Jeroboam built competing temples at Bethel and at Dan after seceding from Judah to establish the independent kingdom of Israel; Jeroboam did not want his new kingdom to be dependent on Judah for his people's religious needs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The First Temple was totally destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BCE when they sacked the city. Construction of the Second Temple was authorized by Cyrus the Great of Persia and began in 538 BCE, one year after the fall of the Babylonian Empire. The temple narrowly avoided being destroyed again in 332 BCE when the Jews refused to acknowledge the deification of Alexander the Great, and had to be rededicated in 164 BCE after Seleucid occupiers defiled the temple by sacrificing pigs to their gods there. The Temple underwent a magnificent renovation under Herod the Great in 19 BCE, but was destroyed for final time by the Romans in 70 CE during the Siege of Jerusalem. After another failed revolt in 135 CE, Jews were banned from Jerusalem entirely.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Following the Muslim conquest of the Holy Land in the 7th century, Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan ordered the construction of an Islamic shrine, the Dome of the Rock, on the site of the Temple. The shrine has stood on the mount since 691 CE; the al-Aqsa Mosque also stands in what was the Temple courtyard. All that remains of the old Jewish temple is a retaining wall on the western face of the hill, now known as the "Wailing Wall" in reference to the practice of Jews weeping at the site over the destruction of their Temples.</Text>
