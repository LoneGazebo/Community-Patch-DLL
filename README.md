# Community-Patch-DLL

This is the repository for the Civ V SDK + Vox Populi Mod. 

## What is Vox Populi

Started in 2014, Vox Populi (formerly known as the "Community Balance Patch/Overhaul") is a collaborative effort to improve Civilization V's AI and gameplay. It consists of a collection of mods (see below) that are designed to work together seamlessly.

* The Community Patch (CP) is the base mod
	* Contains the gamecore DLL, which is based on C++ code linked against the official Civ V SDK
    * Contains bugfixes (also for multiplayer), performance improvements and many AI enhancements, but minimal gameplay changes
    * Can be used standalone and is the basis for many other mods
* Vox Populi
	* Expands and changes the core mechanics of the game, offering an entirely new Civilization V experience that feels and plays like an evolution of the series
	* Includes City-State Diplomacy by Gazebo, Civ 4 Diplomacy Features by Putmalk and More Luxuries by Barathor
* EUI (optional)
	* Enhanced User Interface
