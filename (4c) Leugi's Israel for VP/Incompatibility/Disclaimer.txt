This mod replaces CityBannerManager.lua... Any mod that also does this might be incompatible, 
so please rename this file if you're experiencing issues. The reason to do this is aesthetic,
if you get the Heir event you might choose Solomon over Absalom and Absalom turns one of your cities
barbarian... When you click on a Barbarian city banner you meet an unexistant grey screen leader, so
in order to avoid that, this file makes it so clicking a barbarian banner doesn't do a thing.

If you're up to make compatibility yourself though, add this:

if not player:IsBarbarian() then
	UI.SetRepeatActionPlayer(ePlayer);
	UI.ChangeStartDiploRepeatCount(1);
    player:DoBeginDiploWithHuman();
else
	return
end
