			<Text>During the early medieval period, Chanceries emerged in Europe as a branch of many royal households. Tasked with issuing court documents, managing royal decrees, administering justice, and assessing a monarch's revenue, Chanceries dabbled in every element of statecraft, including diplomacy. As kingdoms and states grew in size and scope throughout the early modern period, the power of Chanceries continually expanded until, in the 17th and 18th centuries, most western countries legally separated Chanceries into multiple, more specific bureaus. Thus, the Chancery is the ancestor of the modern civil service.</Text>

			<Text>Though taken for granted today, the establishment of regional, national and eventually international news agencies (or wire services) was a major boon to the economic, political and cultural interconnectivity of the world. By standardizing the speed, quality and stability of communication on a global scale, modern news agencies are not only useful for spreading popular and intellectual knowledge, but also the acceleration of discourse between governments. Eventually, most countries would create national wire services that focused on foreign affairs and diplomacy. Many of these organizations were under the control of a nation's foreign bureau.</Text>

			<Text>From a single print shop in Mainz, Germany, printing had spread to no less than around 270 cities in Central, Western and Eastern Europe by the end of the 15th century. As early as 1480, it is assumed that "the printed book was in universal use in Europe". By 1500, the printing presses in operation throughout Western Europe had already produced more than twenty million copies. European printing presses of around 1600 were capable of producing 3,600 impressions per workday. By comparison, movable type printing in the Far East, which did not know presses and was solely done by manually rubbing the back of the paper to the page, did not exceed an output of forty pages per day. The rapidity of typographical text production, as well as the sharp fall in unit costs, led to the issuing of the first newspapers which opened up an entirely new field for conveying up-to-date information to the public.</Text>

			<Text>The position of royal scrivener, and the office therein, is one of the oldest and most important positions within a civil service.

Scrivener's wielded immense power, as they had control over the wording, translations and interpretations of the laws of the land.

			<Text>The "Ehrenhalle" (Hall of Honor) was built by the city of Nuremberg according to a plan of German architect Fritz Mayer. It was inaugurated in 1930, before the Hitler era during the Weimar Republic. It is an arcaded hall with an adjacent cobbled stone terrace with two rows of pedestals for fire bowls. All fourteen pylons remain virtually intact and have not been ignited since the final Nazi party rally in September, 1938. Originally, the hall was to be a memorial site for the 9,855 soldiers from Nuremberg who were fallen in World War I. During the Party Congress of 1929 the then unfinished "Hall of Honour" was used for the enactment of a cult of the dead by the National Socialists for the first time. During the Third Reich, the Nazis used the site primarily as a commemoration for the fallen soldiers of World War I and a commemoration of the 16 dead of the "Hitlerputsch" (the so-called "Martyrs of the NS Movement") (Beer Hall Putsch) on 9 November, 1923, in Munich. Hitler, accompanied by SS-leader Heinrich Himmler and SA-leader Viktor Lutze, strode through the arena over the 240 meters long granite path from the main grandstand to the terrace of the Ehrenhalle and showed the Nazi salute there. The ritual was the climax of the celebration.</Text>

An International Financial Center, sometimes abbreviated to IFC, is a non-specific term usually used to describe an important participant in international financial market trading, usually having at least one major stock market. During much of the 20th century, the United States and its financial capital, New York City, were the leaders. But since the 1990s, with the rise of a multipolar world with new regional powers and global capitalism, numerous financial centres have challenged the predominance of Wall Street, particularly from Asia, which some analysts believe will be the focus of new worldwide growth.</Text>

				The Grand Canal is the largest canal in Venice, Italy, and remains one of the most important trade and traffic corridors in the city. As a city of small islands, Venice was enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soils to raise the marshy ground above the tides, the results of which were a series of flooded channels. These channels, or canals, encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city from the Middle Ages well into the present day. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city. The maze of canals threaded through the city requires the use of more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened Ponte della Costituzione, the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, connecting the Piazzale Roma bus terminal area with the Stazione Ferroviaria (train station), the others being the original Ponte di Rialto, the Ponte dell'Accademia, and the Ponte degli Scalzi.</Text>

				An Olympic Village is an accommodation center built for the Olympic Games, usually within an Olympic Park or elsewhere in a host city. Olympic Villages are built to house all participating athletes, as well as officials and athletic trainers. The idea of the Olympic Village comes from Pierre de Coubertin. Up until the 1924 Summer Olympic Games, National Olympic Committees rented locations around the host city to house participants, which was expensive. For the 1924 Summer Olympics, the organizers built cabins near the Stade Olympique de Colombes to allow the athletes to easily access the Games' venues. The Olympic Village of the 1932 Summer Olympics served as the model of today's Olympic Villages; it consisted of a group of buildings with rooms to lodge athletes, and buildings with other accommodations.

				The Crystal Palace was a cast-iron and plate-glass building originally erected in Hyde Park, London, England, to house the Great Exhibition of 1851. More than 14,000 exhibitors from around the world gathered in the Palace's 990,000 square feet of exhibition space to display examples of the latest technology developed in the Industrial Revolution. Designed by Sir Joseph Paxton, the Great Exhibition building was 1,851 feet long, with an interior height of 128 feet. Because of the recent invention of the cast plate glass method in 1848, which allowed for large sheets of cheap but strong glass, it was at the time the largest amount of glass ever seen in a building and astonished visitors with its clear walls and ceilings that did not require interior lights, thus a "Crystal Palace."
