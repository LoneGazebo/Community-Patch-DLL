Though built for travel, it had style, from simple decorations to carefully sewn patterns. The ordo moved with the Khan and his warriors as they went on campaign, ensuring they always felt at home no matter where they traveled.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]You can construct an Ordo anywhere within your territory, or directly adjacent to your territory. Upon constructing the Ordo, your Military Unit Supply Cap will increase by 1, and your Culture borders will also expand to surround the Ordo on all sides by one hex.

			<Text>{TXT_KEY_CIV5_IMPROVEMENTS_EKI_HELP}[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]'Eki' is a term that the Huns likely used to describe the earth, particularly that which was essential to grazing livestock. Nomadic pastoralism is a form of pastoralism where livestock are herded in order to find fresh pastures on which to graze. Strictly speaking, true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed. However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both—in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case. The herded livestock include cattle, yaks, sheep, goats, reindeer, horses, donkeys or camels, or mixtures of species. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practised in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world. Of the estimated 30 to 40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa. Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next. Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice.</Text>

			<Text>Haciendas are colonial estates constructed by the Spanish for the administration and extraction of resources from their native subjects. Haciendas were based on grants of property and enterprise, rather than the strict grant of indigenous labor as described by the older Encomienda system. Haciendas were generally large estates, but the nature of the work varied from plantations, to mining, to factories.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The owner of a Hacienda was called a Hacendado, but the wealthy landowners rarely visited their holdings and preferred to live in nearby cities. Day-to-day operations of a Hacienda were the responsibility of hired managers. Some unusually large and profitable Haciendas were the property of the Roman Catholic Church, exacerbating tension between native laborers and their Christian taskmasters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hacienda system was abolished in most countries after the dissolution of the Spanish Empire, but with mixed results. Efforts to break apart the large estates into individual holdings for subsistence farmers led to crushing poverty in some South American nations. In contrast, Latin American and Filipino Haciendas were mostly left intact, but without the same legal standing or permissions of their colonial past.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Provides [ICON_FOOD] Food, [ICON_PRODUCTION] Production, and [ICON_GOLD] Gold.

Can only be built in Shoshone territory.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A tipi is a conical tent, traditionally made of animal skins, and wooden poles. The tipi was used in the encampments of nomadic tribes of the Great Plains in North America. Tipis are stereotypically associated with Native Americans in the United States in general, however Native Americans from places other than the Great Plains mostly used different types of dwellings. The tipi is durable, provides warmth and comfort in winter, is cool in the heat of summer, and is dry during heavy rains. Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move and could be reconstructed quickly upon settling in a new area. This portability was important to Plains Indians with their nomadic lifestyle. Modern tipi covers are usually made of canvas. Contemporary users of tipis include historical reenactors, back-to-the-land devotees, and Native American families attending powwows or encampments who wish to preserve and pass on a part of their heritage and tradition.</Text>

The style is often referred to as a Chinese quadrangle, and is used from relatively dwellings and monasteries to the most grand palaces. The Forbidden City in Beijing is designed as an enormous Siheyuan. All siheyuan are positioned along a east-west axis, with the main entrance facing south. The universality of this plan allows sequential siheyuan to be arranged in long rows, creating sprawling suburbs in many of China's largest cities. The narrow alleyways between these rows of Siheyuan are known as hutongs in northern China, forming long market streets similar to middle-eastern bazaars. Recent changes in city planning and construction have resulted in many historic neighbourhoods being demolished, but there have been coordinated efforts to preserve some districts as a valuable piece of Chinese cultural identity.</Text>
