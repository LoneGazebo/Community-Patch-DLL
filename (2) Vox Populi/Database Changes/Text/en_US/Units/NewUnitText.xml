			<Text>Mounted knights armed with lances proved ineffective against formations of pikemen combined with crossbowmen whose weapons could penetrate most knights' armor. The invention of pushlever and ratchet drawing mechanisms enabled the use of crossbows on horseback, leading to the development of new cavalry tactics. Knights and mercenaries deployed in triangular formations, with the most heavily armored knights at the front. Some of these riders would carry small, powerful all-metal crossbows of their own. Crossbows were eventually replaced in warfare by more powerful gunpowder weapons, although early guns had slower rates of fire and much worse accuracy than contemporary crossbows. Later, similar competing tactics would feature harquebusiers or musketeers in formation with pikemen (pike and shot), pitted against cavalry firing pistols or carbines.</Text>

			<Text>Cuirassiers, from French cuirassier, were cavalry equipped with armour and firearms, first appearing in late 15th-century Europe. This French term means "the one with a cuirass" (cuirasse), the breastplate armour which they wore. The first cuirassiers were produced as a result of armoured cavalry, such as the man-at-arms and demi-lancer, discarding their lances and adopting the use of pistols as their primary weapon. In the later 17th century, the cuirassier lost his limb armour and subsequently employed only the cuirass (breastplate and backplate), and sometimes a helmet. By this time, the sword was the primary weapon of the cuirassier, pistols being relegated to a secondary function.</Text>

			<Text>Where opportunity meets warfare and lawlessness, the life of a soldier can turn quickly to brigandry.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Free Companies, also known as Great Companies or Companies of Adventurers, were bands of mercenary soldiers that operated throughout Europe from the 12th to the early 15th century. Often employed by nobles, they were known for their disregard for the laws of arms and usefulness as raiders. The Free Companies are most famous for their role during the unending conflicts of the 14th century, employed by the English to terrorize the French countryside during the Hundred Years' War.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]While the Companies had work during wartime, they could become a scourge in times of peace; they often took to pillaging the lands of their former employers as soon as they stopped being paid to pillage someone else's. After the Peace of Bretigny in 1360, the Free Companies were released from their service and became uncontrollable. They went from fief to fief, attacking farms and castles alike, operating throughout western Europe and even managing to win against armies fielded against them. The peace and the Plague helped these bands grow in size and audacity, gaining wealth and infamy as they went abroad. Notable companies of this time included the White Company in Italy, the Catalan Company in Greece, and the Tard-Venus in France. Many of these adventurers gained considerable political power from their exploits, such as the Englishman John Hawkwood, who became a wealthy condottiere hired by several Italian states and the Pope.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The rebuilding of Western European states and the formation of professional armies and effective militias during the 15th century brought an end to the use of mercenaries' power. However, the death and destruction wrought by the Free Companies left a deep scar on the European memory.</Text>

			<Text>Studying throughout history, one can witness how colonists, a type of setter, very often occupied land previously home to long-established peoples, designated as indigenous (also called "natives", "Aborigines" or, in the Americas, "Indians"). In some cases (such as Australia), as colonialist mentalities and laws change, the legal ownership of some lands is contested by indigenous people, who either claim or seek restoration of traditional usage, land rights, native title and related forms of legal ownership or partial control. The word "settler" was not originally usually used in relation to unfree labour immigrants, such as slaves (e.g. in the United States), indentured labourers (such as in Colonial America), or convicts (such as in British America, c. 1615–1775; Australia 1788-1868). More recently descendants of these immigrants may argue that they have as much right to use the word "settler" as the descendants of free immigrants. In the figurative usage, a "person who goes first or does something first" also applies to the American English use of "pioneer" to refer to a settler—a person who has migrated to a less occupied area and established permanent residence there, often to colonize the area; as first recorded in English in 1605. In United States history it refers to those people who helped to settle new lands. In this usage, pioneers are usually among the first to an area, whereas settlers can arrive after first settlement and join others in the process of human settlement.[citation needed] This correlates with the work of military pioneers who were tasked with construction of camps before the main body of troops would arrive at the designated camp site.</Text>

			<Text>A cruiser is a type of warship. The term has been in use for several hundred years, and has had different meanings throughout this period. During the Age of Sail, the term cruising referred to certain kinds of missions: independent scouting, raiding or commerce protection fulfilled by a frigate or sloop, which were the cruising warships of a fleet. In the middle of the 19th century, cruiser came to be a classification for the ships intended for this kind of role, though cruisers came in a wide variety of sizes, from the small protected cruiser to armored cruisers which were as large (though not as powerful) as a battleship. By the early 20th century, cruisers could be placed on a consistent scale of warship size, smaller than a battleship but larger than a destroyer. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty placed a formal limit on cruisers, which were defined as warships of up to 10,000 tons displacement carrying guns no larger than 8 inches in calibre. These limits shaped cruisers up until the end of World War II. The very large battlecruisers of the World War I era were now classified, along with battleships, as capital ships.</Text>

Its design had two revolutionary features: an "all-big-gun" armament scheme, with more heavy-caliber guns than previous ships, and steam turbine propulsion. The first of its kind, the Royal Navy's "Dreadnought" mounted ten 12-inch (305 mm) guns. The US Navy was the first to adopt oil-firing, deciding to do so in 1910 and ordering oil-fired boilers for the Nevada class, in 1911. Other major navies retained mixed coal-and-oil firing until the end of World War I.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Within five years of the commissioning of "Dreadnought", a new generation of more powerful "super-dreadnoughts" was being built. The first super-dreadnoughts are generally considered to be the British "Orion" class. What made them "super" was the introduction of the heavier 13.5-inch (343 mm) guns and the placement of all the main armament on the centerline. In 1917, the Japanese "Nagato" class was ordered, the first dreadnoughts to mount 16-inch (406 mm) guns, making them arguably the most powerful warships in the world.</Text>

			<Text>The Emissary is the first diplomatic unit available to a player, and represents the early attempts at peaceful cooperation between civilizations. As the culture of diplomacy is, in the Ancient Era, still quite crude, the Emissary is not terribly effective. Earning only around 20 Influence from a Diplomatic Mission, the Emissary has not yet mastered the art of statecraft, nor, unsurprisingly, the foreign languages of neighbouring city-states. Production cost scales with Era.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_CIV5_ANTIQUITY_EMISSARY_TEXT">
			<Text>Though the cheapest and earliest-available diplomatic unit, Emissaries are not terribly reliable as a source of steady Influence. Players should only use Emissaries to secure or maintain relations with a city-state you are already friendly or allied with. As such, it is best to use these units simply to augment your efforts to fulfill city-state quests.</Text>

			<Text>During the Medieval period, the art of diplomacy finally came of age. New theories on foreign affairs emerged during this time that were no longer based on 'might is right,' but rather the arts of flattery, sophistication and, if necessary, intimidation. The Envoy represents this leap in diplomatic power and, as such, is both more effective than Emissaries and also more expensive. Production cost scales with Era.</Text>

		<Row Tag="TXT_KEY_UNIT_ENVOY_STRATEGY">
			<Text>Envoys are much more useful as sources of diplomatic influence with city-states. This utility, however, comes with increased cost. Players will need ample Paper to supply the demand of their burgeoning diplomatic service. City-state quests are still very important for maintaining friendly or allied relations, however their importance is waning.</Text>

			<Text>Diplomats are very expensive relative to Emissaries and Envoys. Players that have not continually increased their supply of Paper will have a difficult time continuing to have influence on city-states around the world. If, however, you have the resources, and the production, to build diplomats in great numbers, the world will bow before your empire of soft power and persuasive influence.</Text>

			<Text>The modern Ambassador, born out of the tensions created by the rise of atomic warfare, represents the pinnacle of diplomatic power. Years of formal training in linguistics, politics, culture and economics enable Ambassadors to control whatever city-state they choose. These talents, however, make Ambassadors the most costly diplomatic unit in the game - each Ambassador costs almost as much as a Tank! This investment may seem high, however, if a player chooses to abstain from city-state diplomacy, they will quickly see their influence on the global stage decline, as other players will undoubtedly come to dominate the World Congress.

			<Text>Throughout every civilization's history, great mediators, counsellors, and dignitaries have emerged during times of strife or times of great power. Great Diplomats represent these important historical figures and, as such, have the ability to greatly increase a player's diplomatic power. Players may use them to immediately gain a large amount of influence with a city-state, or, if they are looking towards the future, they may be used to build an Embassy in a city-state's land, thus granting the player an additional vote in the World Congress when it is founded.</Text>
