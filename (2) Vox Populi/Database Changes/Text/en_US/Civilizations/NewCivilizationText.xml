			<Text>A National Historic Landmark, the Slater Mill is located next to the Blackstone River in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Modeled after cotton spinning mills first established in England, the Slater Mill is the first water-powered cotton spinning mill in North America to utilize the Arkwright system of cotton spinning as developed by Richard Arkwright. Samuel Slater, the mill's founder, apprenticed as a young man in Belper, England with industrialist Jedediah Strutt. Shortly after immigrating to the United States, Slater was hired by Moses Brown of Providence, Rhode Island to produce a working set of machines necessary to spin cotton yarn using water-power. Construction of the machines, as well as a dam, waterway, waterwheel and mill was completed in 1793. Manufacturing was based on Richard Arkwright's cotton spinning system which included carding, drawing, and spinning machines. Slater initially hired children and families to work in his mill, establishing a pattern that was replicated throughout the Blackstone Valley and known as the "Rhode Island System". It was later eclipsed by Francis Cabot Lowell's Waltham System. Slater Mill was the first property to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and was designated a National Historic Landmark on November 13, 1966.</Text>

			<Text>Long considered the "Sick Man of Europe", Ottoman power was in decline well before nationalist sentiment took root in the Arab population. When WWI broke out among the European powers the Ottomans set about crushing Arab dissent. Arab citizens responded in a popular revolt, declaring a new Islamic empire.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, began the rebellion in hopes of re-establishing a Hashemite dynasty in Arabia, and led his fellow Arabs in armed rebellion against their Turkish masters in Hejaz. Seeing an opportunity to tie down Ottoman forces in a new front, the British promised to recognize Arab hegemony and heavily subsidize the revolt, sending the now famous T.E. Lawrence as a liaison. With this new infusion of funds and equipment, the Arabs waged a guerilla war through the desert, crippling Ottoman supply lines. With the help of French and English navy, they were able to take several ports along the Mediterranean coast, emboldening even more to join their cause.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]With the end of WWI in 1918 and the Ottomans’ defeat, the Arabs expected the full cooperation of their European allies as they established their new kingdom. However, the English and French had other plans. Behind closed doors, the French and English secretly formed the Sykes-Picot Agreement which divided the Middle-East amongst their own respective spheres of influence. This gross betrayal of a trusted ally has soured relations between the Arab states and the West ever since.</Text>

In effect this made Standschützen a Tyrolean local militia and home guard.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Standschützen were periodically called upon to defend their homeland from rebellions and invasions, but their actions in World War I were particularly distinguished. Italy entered late into the war against Austria and opened a new front through the Alpine passes of Tyrol. The Austrians had already committed battalions of Tyrolean recruits elsewhere upon the war's initial outbreak, so the Standschützen consisting of young, elderly, and injured men were called upon to defend their province with little notice or material support. Despite this, the Standschützen fought valiantly in defense of their homes and repulsed the Italians for weeks until regular troops could arrive. It is without a doubt that the actions of the Standschützen saved Autria a devastating loss against a fresh invasion by an opportunistic foe.</Text>

			<Text>Over many centuries, Byzantine architecture gradually drifted away from older Roman forms. Byzantine-style buildings are often noted for their high domes and intricate mosaic work, and far greater use of stone and brick construction. The tetraconch churches, meaning "four shells" in Greek, represent the highest achievement of Byzantine architecture. The floorplan of these buildings incorporates four domed apses, giving the building the shape of a cross, with the central space capped by a high dome. The form was widely used in mausoleums and baptisteries and informed later Ottoman and Renaissance architectural traditions that followed.</Text>

Each individual docking bay featured a raised slipway. Above the raised docking bays was a second level consisting of warehouses where oars and rigging were kept along with supplies such as wood and canvas.

			<Text>In contrast to most Phoenician colonies, Carthage grew larger and more quickly thanks to its combination of favorable climate, arable land, and lucrative trade routes. Within just one century of its founding, its population rose to 30,000. Though the specific date and circumstances are unknown, Carthage became independent in the middle of the 6th century BC. It had grown into a fully independent thalassocracy, embarking its own colonization efforts across the western Mediterranean. Carthage became an expansionist power, driven by its desire to access new sources of wealth and trade. By 300 BC, through its vast patchwork of colonies, vassals, and satellite states, held together by its naval dominance of the western and central Mediterranean Sea, Carthage controlled the largest territory in the region, including the coast of northwestern Africa, southern and eastern Iberia, and the islands of Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica, Malta, and the Balearic Islands.</Text>

			<Text>The word “Oromo” refers to the dominant ethnic group in Ethiopia, making up about a third of the total population. The Oromo at times had their own kingdom, language and religion (although in present-day Ethiopia they are evenly split between Muslims and Christians). During the First Italo-Ethiopian War, when Italy attempted to seize Ethiopia as a colonial possession, the Ethiopian emperor Menelik used Oromo cavalrymen to devastating effect, especially in the decisive Battle of Adwa.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Oromo cavalry were not true cavalry, but mounted infantrymen, meaning that they did not fire weapons from horseback, but would gallop towards the Italians, dismount, and then fire. With their lion’s-mane headdresses and fierce reputation, they became one of the most feared military units of the era. During the Italian invasion, a rumor spread around the Italian camps that Oromo cavalry (whom the Italians called “Galla” – a word that was seen as offensive by the Oromo) would castrate the bodies of enemies that held weapons – a rumor that caused many Italians to toss aside their guns the moment that the Oromo began their charge. Italian soldiers reported their compatriots turning their guns on themselves rather than facing the Oromo. One report depicts a lone Italian survivor of an Oromo attack, dazed out of his mind, unable to say anything but “Galla cavalry. Galla cavalry. Horror. Horror.”</Text>

				The term "Monolithic Church" (or "rock-hewn church") can be attributed to any church cut from a single stone formation, but is most often used to refer to the complex of 11 churches in Lalibela, Ethiopia.

This 'New Jerusalem' is situated in a mountainous region in the heart of Ethiopia, and is an important center of Christian pilgrimage to this day.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Monolithic Churches are found in places besides Lalibela, including many in Tigray. These churches were almost unknown to the outside world until Abba Tewelde Medhin Josief, a Catholic priest, announced the existence of over 120 rock-hewn churches, 90 of which were still in use.

			<Text>World War I saw rapid technological and tactical changes in how wars were fought, including the adoption of aircraft for scouting and bombing. These machines opened an entirely new theatre of war. Despite their promise, the first aircrafts were slow, clumsy, and unreliable due to their underpowered combustion engines. This all changed in 1915 when Marc Birgikt invented a new V8 engine boasting 150 horsepower and weighing only 330 pounds. The French high command saw the new motor's value as an aircraft engine and commissioned a new fighter aircraft: The Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés, or "SPAD" S. VII.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By late 1916, SPAD VIIs were beginning to see action, and were widely adopted by allied pilots for the rest of the war. Though lacking the maneuverability of older Nieuport fighters, the SPAD VII was unmatched in sheer speed, travelling in excess of 127mph and capable of diving at more than 249mph. Pilots created entirely new tactics to leverage this speed, which gave the SPAD the ability to safely avoid pitched battles. The added stability in diving was especially appreciated over the old Nieuports, which had a bad habit of shedding their wings during maneuvers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Air superiority became a constant arms race against newer and better German designs and engines. By the end of the war, the SPAD VII's single .303 Vickers machine gun was outmatched by German fighters, which carried at least two machine guns. The heavier and faster SPAD XIII eventually replaced the SPAD VII by late 1917, and saw France through the remainder of the War. Despite its shortcomings, the SPAD series is remembered as one of the fastest and most powerful of WWI fighters.</Text>

			<Text>Through and through, Germany is a beer culture, whose historic and cultural ties to the drink date back to antiquity. With the professionalization and commodification of brewing in the middle ages, beer moved from a private cottage industry into the inns and public houses, which took the form of Brewhouses (Bräuhauser) and Beer Halls (Bierhaller) in Germany. The greatest and most renowned Brewhouses are found in the Free State of Bavaria, where beer halls, beer gardens, and the annual Oktoberfest have become synonymous with Bavarian culture. Especially notable breweries are found throughout Munich, which are all historically subject to the Bavarian Beer Purity Law -- the Reinheitsegebot -- which dictated that the only ingredients that could be used in the production of beer were water, barley and hops. Adopted by the Bavarian state in 1516, the Reinheitsegebot is one of the oldest pieces of food safety legislation still in effect today. Even before the rise of German nationalism, the Reinheitsegebot had inspired similar regulation in nearby kingdoms and its universal adoption was a condition of Bavaria's unification with Germany in 1871.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As a place where light and food were freely available, the Brewhouses were a cornerstone of public life in southern Germany, acting as the birthplace for numerous revolutionary ideas and movements that gripped Germany in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the wake of the French Revolution, German liberals organized in the Beer Halls of Munich to demand reforms of the monarchy in a series of uprisings from 1848 to 1849. During the 1910s, Vladimir Lenin was a frequent patron of the Munich Hofbräuhaus, where he did much of his political agitations and initial founding of the Bolshevik party, which would go on to form the Soviet Union. Most famous, however, was Adolf Hitler, who announced the formation of his National Socialist (Nazi) Party at the Hofbräuhaus am Platzl in 1920, and was arrested for treason in 1923 after a failed coup d'état at the Bürgerbräukeller. This episode became known as the Beer Hall Putsch, and the resulting trial gave Hitler a national platform to spread his political ideology, leading to his widespread fame and the rise of German fascism.</Text>

The Krupp Guns were the first cast steel field guns to enter mass production and adoption by any military, with the Royal Prussian Army's first purchase in 1856. Krupp Guns were renowned for their quality and for being at the forefront of new developments in artillery.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the outbreak of World War I, the German army doctrine emphasized mobility and the use of howitzer guns which fired in higher arcs to hit entrenched enemies at steeper angles. This doctrine paid early dividends during the initial stages of the Schlieffen Plan, where smaller, lighter German guns worked well as they marched through Belgium and Northern France, and raced the British to the sea. Though the bulk of their artillery was smaller pieces, like the 7.7 cm FK 96, the Germans also had some of the most impressive heavy artillery of the war with the Minenwerfers, or "mine throwers", short range artillery that outperformed contemporary mortars at a fraction of the weight. As the war began, Germany deployed twelve experimental 45 cm minenwerfer siege guns, some of the largest field artillery pieces ever produced. Affectionately dubbed "Big Bertha" by the German troops, these siege guns punched through dozens of hardened fortresses around Liege and Mauberge, taking the German army within striking distance of Paris in a matter of weeks.</Text>

Nomadic pastoralism is a form of pastoralism where livestock are herded in order to find fresh grazing land. Strictly speaking, true nomads follow an irregular pattern of movement, in contrast with transhumance where seasonal pastures are fixed. However this distinction is often not observed and the term nomad used for both—in historical cases the regularity of movements is often unknown in any case. The herded livestock include cattle, yaks, sheep, goats, reindeer, horses, donkeys or camels, or mixtures of species. Nomadic pastoralism is commonly practiced in regions with little arable land, typically in the developing world. Of the estimated 30 to 40 million nomadic pastoralists worldwide, most are found in central Asia and the Sahel region of West Africa. Increasing numbers of stock may lead to overgrazing of the area and desertification if lands are not allowed to fully recover between one grazing period and the next. Increased enclosure and fencing of land has reduced the amount of land available for this practice.</Text>

			<Text>Unlike many other tribes, the Iroquois had easy access to trade goods at Dutch forts along the Hudson River, and traded for various goods and luxuries. Weapons of war such as the iron axe and musket were highly sought after, and by the 1640s the Iroquois were well-equipped to fight their traditional Huron and Algonquian enemies. Common muskets were given in exchange for pelts and food, but often of lighter and smaller caliber than military-grade muskets. The Dutch and British feared giving high-quality weapons to people who could turn against them, but the Iroquois often found the smaller weapons more suitable to rough terrain anyways.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]War tactics were changed after the Iroquois' acquisition of firearms. The lethality of their new weapons put the Iroquois, never a highly populous group, in a precarious position. The tribes' custom of absorbing refugees and prisoners of war changed as fewer and fewer warriors survived clashes with European arms. Great armies walking with prominent chiefs and shamans were replaced with guerilla tactics, small bands of troops guided by commanders.</Text>

			<Text>The Mesoamerican Ball Game, or 'Pitz', is a game of ritual and cultural significance among the Mayan people. The object of the game is to keep the ball in play for as long as possible by striking back and forth within a sloped arena using the hips, though some variations allowed for elbows, shoulders and even rackets. The earliest archaeological evidence of the game come from a court estimated to be 3400 years old.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over 1300 different ballcourts have been found within Mayan ruins, with relatively little variation in size or layout over thousands of years. Every court is shaped as a narrow alley with gently sloping walls on either side and enclosed endzones. This gave the court a roughly H-shaped layout. Later versions of the ballcourts would include hoops at the midpoint, suspended on the walls. Actually sending a ball through the ring must have been a rare occurrence, since the players could not use their hands or feet to guide the ball. Moreover, the rings were only slightly larger than the ball itself and were a long way from the playing alley.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The game was more than a mere sporting event to the Mayan people, serving as a substitute for war in the case of a dispute between cities. Later Classical Mayan art suggests a link between the ball game and ritual sacrifice, with winners being decapitated as an offering to the gods. The Maya Twin Myth of the Popol Vuh describes the game between the Hero Twins, Hunahpu and Xbalanque, and lords of the underworld, One Death and Seven Death. The game was played so the Hero Twins might recover Hunahpu's head, which was being used as a ball by the Lords (Hunahpu had been using a squash for his head until his real one could be recovered).</Text>

Squabbles over land, influence, and resources were common, but the need for human sacrifices was also a factor leading to war.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The nobility and priesthood of Mayan cities kept a monopoly on violence, making all but the most desperate of wars strictly within the affairs of the upper class.

The officers regularly paid for group portraits of the members, some of which are still highly regarded as the finest paintings produced by the Dutch Golden Age.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The training grounds for schutters were called Doelen, meaning "target range". Doelen typically were placed near the city walls and consisted of an outdoor firing range with an adjoining hall for gymnastic exercise and meetings. Many Doelen throughout the Netherlands have been preserved, though often converted into school gymnasiums, libraries, or community halls.</Text>

			<Text>A Goedendag is a four-foot long club with a spearhead at its tip that was used by the militias of Medieval Flanders during the Franco-Flemish War. The weapon was christened "goedendag" by the French, a cognate with the Dutch greeting "good day". This name may be a reference to the Bruges Matins massacre of 1302, in which the guildsmen of Bruges took over the city by greeting people in the streets and murdering anyone who answered with a French accent.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Goedendags were used to great effect by the guildsmen of Flanders against the French knights, but exactly how the weapon was used is a source of debate. Contemporary illustrations show it being used as a club, written accounts describe its first use as a spear to meet a charge, then a club as the enemy was halted. However they worked, men armed with Goedendags marked the beginning of the end for heavy cavalry in Western Europe, and the dawn of an "Infantry Revolution" where peasant militia were now a credible threat to professional soldiers. The stunning victory of common men over foreign tyrants became a wellspring of romantic nationalism for the Low Countries.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"each held his godendart (sic) raised against the French, the iron as one meets a wild boar"[NEWLINE]- Guillaume Guiart, a contemporary account describing the battle of Courtrai, 1302 A.D.</Text>

The super-sized bombards of the late medieval were first used in Western European warfare at the beginning of the 15th century, but it was the Ottomans that would realize the bombard's full potential at the Siege of Constantinople in 1453. Unable to find patronage with the Byzantine emperor, a Hungarian gunfounder named Orban sold his services to Mehmed II of the Ottoman Empire, and began crafting bronze cannons capable of lobbing 1.6 tons of shaped stone more than a mile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Transporting such massive weapons took as many as 60 oxen, and required construction of entire road networks before the cannons could be brought to bear against the impregnable Theodosian Walls. Within a day of the opening bombardment, massive stones smashed the outer defenses to rubble and the city which had stood as a fortress of Christendom for a millennium fell. The sack of Constantinople raged for three days following, and triggered a mass exodus of Greeks into Europe proper. The influx of Byzantine refugees brought a rediscovery of the philosophical and intellectual achievements of Greek culture into Western Europe, planting the seeds of the Renaissance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Stone bombards were supplanted by iron-ball cannons by the end of the 16th century, and few bombards are left intact.

				The Turkish word 'Tersane' is derived from the Venetian 'darsane', from which the English word 'arsenal' is also derived. Though never at the forefront of shipbuilding technology, the Ottomans enjoyed over a century of naval dominance in the Mediterranean following their conquest of Constantinople in 1453. The largest Tersane, constructed at the Golden Horn across from Constantinople, housed over 160 docks, drydocks, storehouses and supply depots, making it one of the largest centers of commerce and industry in the Mediterranean.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
				Ottoman naval power was maintained through its tremendous shipbuilding capacity and its allegiances to the Barbary corsairs of North Africa. This pre-eminence was finally ended at the battle of Lepanto, where a combined Spanish and Venetian armada delivered a crushing defeat to the Ottomans, capturing or destroying more than two thirds of the Ottoman navy. In response, the Ottomans built 250 new vessels within six months.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]

Named for their distinctive crimson headwear, the Qizilbash organized into a Shi'ite society reminiscent of a European knightly order. Though primarily of Turkman origin, the Qizilbash proved instrumental in the establishment of the Iranian Safavid Dynasty.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In a campaign to avenge the death of his father, Ismail I led 7000 Qizilbash warriors to victory over an Aq Qoyunlu force of 30 000, and established the Safavid State. Within eleven short years, Ismail brought all of Iran under his control, becoming the first ethnically Iranian monarch to unify Iran in over 850 years. Though they had made him a powerful king, Ismail feared the influence of the Qizilbash over the Iranian people. Ismail and his successors would spend the next 80 years diminishing the threat posed by the foreign Qizilbash, replacing them with slave soldiers from the Caucasus. Nevertheless, the Qizilbash maintained a place of honor within the Safavid Empire, both on the battlefield and at court.</Text>

Pancerni were organized into companies, with each company consisting of 60 to 200 horsemen. Exceptionally well-armored, they used chainmail or platemail armor, vambraces, helmets, and buckler shields. The most common armaments were sabres, reflex bows and, with the arrival of gunpowder, flintlock pistols and carbines.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the rise of heavy cavalry the Pancerni often worked in concert with the newer and more heavily armed husaria, augmenting a cavalry charge and chasing down routing enemy soldiers. By the second half of the 17th century, they represented approximately 70% of all soldiers in the Polish military, fighting against Cossacks, Tatars, and the Swedish. The Husaria and Pancerni were eventually combined to form the ‘Kawaleria Narodowa’, the Polish-Lithuanian National Cavalry.</Text>

Over the progressive conquests and expansion of Roman territories and wealth, the villa evolved from relatively simple getaways for social elites into extravagant centers of sprawling agricultural landholdings called Latifundia, an ancient precursor to today’s agribusinesses. The first latifundia were created from land confiscated from conquered peoples in the early 2nd century BC in Magna Graecia (Southern Italy). The Latifundia system expanded with later conquests into Spain and North Africa.
			[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]These estates depended on forced labor for their productivity, often supplied by the enslavement of the same people who occupied the land before conquest. The Latifundia consolidated agricultural production into larger estates with greater economies of scale; owners re-invested profits by purchasing small neighbouring farms to increase their own holdings. Evicted from their farms and replaced by slave labour, the Roman peasantry were forced to find work in the cities of Rome, though often resorting to squatting and handouts.

The tipi was used in the encampments of nomadic tribes of the Great Plains in North America. Tipis are stereotypically associated with Native Americans in the United States in general, however Native Americans from places other than the Great Plains mostly used different types of dwellings. The tipi is durable, provides warmth and comfort in winter, is cool in the heat of summer, and is dry during heavy rains. Tipis could be disassembled and packed away quickly when a tribe decided to move and could be reconstructed quickly upon settling in a new area. This portability was important to Plains Indians with their nomadic lifestyle. Modern tipi covers are usually made of canvas. Contemporary users of tipis include historical reenactors, back-to-the-land devotees, and Native American families attending powwows or encampments who wish to preserve and pass on a part of their heritage and tradition.</Text>

Large herds of buffalo were corralled and funneled into the pound, a sturdy circular ring of hides and wood, where tribesmen could throw spears and other missile weapons from the safety of the walls.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Buffalo were a staple food source on the North American Plains, but hunting such large animals was difficult without horses or sturdy weapons. With the arrival of Europeans and the introduction of the horse and musket, Native American tribes could travel great distances and attack bison herds with impunity. The good times would not last, however, as Europeans encroached upon this way of life. Increasingly, the Great Plains were converted into farms and pastures for American homesteaders. The American buffalo was driven to the brink of extinction by a combination of habitat loss, industrial-scale hunting, and culls engineered to starve the indigenous population.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, American buffalo have recovered, but their range has been greatly limited to a few national parks. Commercial farming and sport hunting continues, but the buffalo are unlikely to ever return to their historical numbers.</Text>

			<Text>Yellow Brows (Sh. Ohamupe) were one of two military societies within the Shoshone, playing an integral role in hunting, scouting, and policing within their bands. Yellow Brow braves shaved their heads into a cockscomb 'mohawk', and painted their exposed heads yellow, hence their common English name.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Yellow Brows were composed of only the bravest and most daring of the young men, tasked with keeping order on hunting expeditions, scouting, and soldiering. The Society never had more than a few hundred members at a time; members elected their replacement upon graduation. A young Yellow Brow was expected to act and speak in a contrarian way as a sign of membership.  For instance, when asked if he would like to join the Yellow Brows, it was expected that the young man would say 'No' as a sign of willingness to join, or 'Yes' if he wished to decline.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In battle, Yellow Brows were led by a war chief who carried a long cane tipped with a stone or metal dagger.  The cane was used to grab and unhorse opponents, or as a No-Retreat signal. If the enemy was gaining the upper hand, the chief would drive his staff into the ground and the braves would defend him to the last. Yellow Brows were banned from leaving their chief's side until another member of the tribe came and released the braves from their charge. Deserting the chief was met with abject mockery, and often resulted in banishment from the tribe.</Text>

Haciendas were generally large estates, but the nature of the work varied from plantations, to mining, to factories.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The owner of a Hacienda was called a Hacendado, but the wealthy landowners rarely visited their holdings and preferred to live in nearby cities. Day-to-day operations of a Hacienda were the responsibility of hired managers. Some unusually large and profitable Haciendas were the property of the Roman Catholic Church, exacerbating tension between native laborers and their Christian taskmasters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Hacienda system was abolished in most countries after the dissolution of the Spanish Empire, but with mixed results. Efforts to break apart the large estates into individual holdings for subsistence farmers led to crushing poverty in some South American nations.

In the end, however, it was not firepower, but speed which won the day, allowing the small English vessels to harry the lumbering Spanish Juggernaut, sinking 10 ships. When finally forced to retire to Spain, a navigational error blew the Armada off-course and onto the Irish coast, where fierce storms dashed the ships against the rocks. When the Armada managed to reach Spain, only 67 of the original 130 ships remained, full of sickly, starving, and demoralized sailors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The lessons of the Spanish Armada informed naval strategy for the next two centuries. Cannons and ranged action had now overtaken boarding and ramming as the primary methods of attack; sinking, rather than capturing, was now the priority.

When studying at a university, however, you might have to pay for accommodation and literature. There are private schools as well who also receive funding from the government, but they may charge a fee from the parents.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Compulsory education starts at seven years of age, with an optional year in förskola (pre-school). The Swedish primary school is split into three parts; Lågstadiet – “the low stage”, which covers grades 1 to 3. This is where you learn the basics of the three main subjects – in Swedish called kärnämnen – Swedish, English and mathematics. It also includes some natural science. Mellanstadiet – “the middle stage”, which covers grades 4 to 6, introduces the children to more detailed subjects. Woodwork and needlework, social and domestic science, and even a second, foreign language in grade 6, a B-språk (B-language). The languages available are usually French, Spanish or German depending on the school. Högstadiet, “the high stage”, is the last stage of the compulsory education, between grades 7 and 9. This is when studies get more in-depth and are taken to an international level.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Swedish children take national exams at grades 3, 6 and 9. Children at grade 3 take these exams in two of the three main subjects: Swedish and mathematics. In grade 5 the exams extend to the third main subject, English, and in grade 9 the exams also extend to natural science, foreign languages, and one of the four subjects in "Samhällsorientering" (geography, history, religious studies, and civics). They first receive grades in grade 6. The grading system is letter-based, ranging from A-F, where F is the lowest grade and A is the highest. F means "not approved", while all other ratings above F mean "approved". There are only objectives for E, C and A; D means the person has met most (but not all) objectives for C, while B means the person has met most objectives for A. When applying to gymnasium (high schools) or universities, a meritvärde (“meritous point value”) is calculated. E is worth 10 points, D 12.5 points, C 15 points, and so on. Children not being approved in Swedish, English and mathematics will have to study at a special high school program called the “individual program”. Once they are approved, they may apply to an ordinary high school program. Swedes study at high school for three years, between the ages of 16 and 18.</Text>

			<Text>Murano's reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and the destruction of the city’s mostly wooden buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still associated with Venetian glass. Murano's glassmakers were soon numbered among the island’s most prominent citizens. By the fourteenth century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. While benefiting from certain statutory privileges, glassmakers were forbidden to leave the Republic. However, many of them took the risks associated with migration and established glass furnaces in surrounding cities and farther afield, even in England and the Netherlands.</Text>

			<Text>An Iziko is a simple hearth used as a gathering place for Zulu communities. The fireplace was revered as a source for food, warmth, dreams, and ancestral ties. It is from these gatherings that a sense of community and identity was formed, and young Zulus could perform and bond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The fireplace is used metaphorically for the "cooking of songs" in isicathamiya stage performances, a modern offshoot of traditional Zulu music. Dreams were an essential part of communicating with ancestors and formed part of a deeply rooted Zulu religion. Some isicathamiya musicians claim some of their songs were created in the spiritual realm or given to them by their ancestors.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"A person is a person because of other people"[NEWLINE]-Zulu proverb</Text>

			<Text>An InDuna can widely be translated to any leader of men, in commerce, in politics, and in war. An InDuna guided each regiment, or 'ibutho', of young Zulu men and he in turn answered to senior izinDuna who controlled the corps. One or more of these elder chiefs might accompany a big force on an important mission, but there was no single "field marshal" in command of all Zulu forces. Regimental izinDuna, like the non-commissioned officers of today's army, were important for morale and discipline. This was demonstrated during the battle of Isandlwana, where the army led by Ntshingwayo kaMahole outmaneuvered and destroyed a British column. Ntshingwayo kaMahole and his fellow izinDuna snuck a Zulu force of 20 000 men behind the British, hiding them in a valley only 7 miles from the British camp. When discovered sitting in complete silence by scouts, the izinDuna spurred their men into action and closed the remaining distance with lightning speed.</Text>
