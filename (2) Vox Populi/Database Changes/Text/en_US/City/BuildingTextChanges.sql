The liability of the owners was limited to what they had invested or guaranteed to the company.[NEWLINE]These companies were granted exclusive rights through royal charters, enabling them to trade, explore, and colonize specific regions. Acting as quasi-sovereign entities, chartered companies established settlements, raised armies, and conducted diplomacy with indigenous peoples, wielding considerable political power and generating immense wealth for their home countries.[NEWLINE]Notable examples include the Dutch East India Company (VOC, 1602-1799) and the English East India Company (EIC, 1600-1874), which played pivotal roles in European expansion and colonialism in South and East Asia.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Operating in various geographical regions, chartered companies faced differing levels of success. While those in Asia, like the VOC and the EIC, thrived due to large investments and state support, those in the Atlantic world struggled amidst private competition and limited profitability. A successful exception was the Hudson Bay Company (HBC): established in 1670, the company traded in furs and European goods within the area where the rivers fed the bay.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Chartered companies were integral to early modern political economy, reflecting responses to Spanish and Portuguese expansion in the 16th century. While perceived as tools for promoting state wealth and power, they faced criticism for draining national economies and generating private fortunes, notably in the case of the EIC.[NEWLINE]By the late 18th century, chartered companies fell out of favor in Europe, although the British revived the concept in colonial ventures in Africa during the late 19th century.'

In Europe, the earliest universities emerged spontaneously as a scholastic guild, whether of masters or students, without any express authorization of a prince, king, pope or prelate.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In many cases, however, universities petitioned secular power for privileges. Emperor Frederick I in Authentica Habita (1158) gave the first privileges to students in Bologna. Another step was Pope Alexander III in 1179 requiring that masters of church schools give licenses to properly qualified teachers and forbidding them from charging for it. The integrity of a university was only preserved in such an internally regulated corporation, which protected the scholars from external intervention. This independently evolving organization was absent in the universities of southern Italy and Spain, which served the bureaucratic needs of monarchs, and were therefore their artificial creations.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The University of Paris was formally recognized when Pope Gregory IX issued the bull Parens scientiarum (1231). This was a revolutionary step: studium generale (universities) and universitas (corporations of students or teachers) existed beforehand, but after the issuing of the bull, they attained autonomy. The papal bull of 1233 stipulated that anyone admitted as a teacher in Toulouse had the right to teach everywhere without further examinations. In time, this privilege became the single most important defining characteristic of the university and the symbol of its institutional autonomy. By the year 1292, even the two oldest universities, Bologna and Paris, felt the need to seek similar bulls from Pope Nicholas IV.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Meanwhile, in the Islamic world, institutions such as madrasas and the House of Wisdom in Baghdad (established in the late 8th century) played vital roles in preserving and advancing knowledge, spanning fields from theology to medicine.[NEWLINE]Outside of Europe and the Islamic world, East Asia saw the rise of educational centers like the Imperial Academy in China (founded in 3 AD under Emperor Ping of Han as Taixue, then renamed Guozijian after the Sui dynasty) as well as the National Confucian Academy in Korea (Sungkyunkwan, 1398), which emphasized Confucian teachings and governmental administration. The Imperial Examination system in China further democratized access to education by selecting officials based on merit rather than birthright, fostering social mobility and intellectual development. These diverse educational systems in medieval times contributed to the spread of knowledge, cultural exchange, and societal progress, leaving a lasting impact on the intellectual landscape of their respective regions.'
