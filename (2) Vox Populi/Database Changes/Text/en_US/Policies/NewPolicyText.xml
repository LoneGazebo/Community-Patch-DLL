			<Text>Ruling with an iron fist generally means to require absolute control when managing other people, often in the workplace. The saying can also refer to situations such as child-rearing or styles of government. This idiom is often used to describe the actions and practices of managers, parents, or leaders who give their subordinates little if any freedom of choice or input regarding decisions. Reasons for ruling with an iron fist can often depend on individual circumstances, such as inexperienced workers or unruly children. The effectiveness of using total control can also vary, depending on the scope of the management style and the situation.</Text>

			<Text>The phrase 'Peace, Land, Bread,' popularized by Lenin and others during the early days of the Soviet Revolution, highlighted their desire to focus on the needs of the impoverished Russian peasantry. The Bolshevik Initial Decrees of the 1910-20s were announced as soon as the Bolsheviks declared their success in the October Revolution (October 26, 1917). The decrees conformed to the popular Bolshevik slogan "Peace, Bread, and Land", taken up by the masses during the July Days (July 1917), an uprising of workers and military forces.</Text>

			<Text>Transnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs. Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization. Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.</Text>

			<Text>National syndicalism is an adaptation of syndicalism to suit the social agenda of integral nationalism. National syndicalism suggests that the people must defend themselves through the development of Syndicalist sections into massive economic worker movements. These should take immediate action to expropriate the capitalists. These should also take direct action to let the workers lead the production and to form peoples communes. National syndicalism seeks out principled reasons for direct economic action and denounces parliamentary action by representatives. The goal is not to make capitalism bearable, but the realisation of a free Nationalist and Socialist nation. National syndicalism aims to move the attention from the political terrain to the economic terrain. It wants the socialisation from the basis: a system of distribution from local units, in consultation with the National federation, on the fundament of a production and consumption statistic. As well as the organisation of the production by national industrial federations.</Text>
