Captured from Spain by the English and Dutch in 1704 and ceded to England in 1713, Gibraltar has been a British possession ever since (much to the annoyance of Spain, which wants it back). Commanding the entrance to the Atlantic from the Mediterranean, Gibraltar has been a major British naval base for three hundred years.[NEWLINE]Most of Gibraltar is covered by the "Rock," a huge formation of shale, sandstone and limestone thrust up by the unimaginable power of plate tectonics. The Rock stands some 1400 feet in height. At one time Gibraltar was a massive fortification allowing Britain to dominate the narrow Mediterranean-Atlantic passage, but today the peninsula is more of a nature preserve and tourist destination than it is a military base.'

First seen by Europeans in 1870 (and by natives some 10,000 years before that), Old Faithful was thus named because of the regularity of its eruption. The geyser shoots a column of boiling water to a height of some 100-175 feet every 60-90 minutes (the interval determined by the ferocity of the previous eruption). Geysers occur when subterranean water hits magma (molten rock). The water is instantly turned to steam, which rushes out the nearest available opening at tremendously high pressure.
