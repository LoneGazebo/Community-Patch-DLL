Founded before the early medieval period, the settlement became a center of Christian learning and governance, eventually housing one of Scotland's oldest surviving round towers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]By the 11th century AD, Abernethy was an influential religious hub under Pictish and later Scottish rule, serving as a monastic center. The establishment of religious institutions solidified its prominence, with connections to the expanding Christian church across the British Isles. The area was also historically linked to Scottish royalty, with several significant treaties and power shifts occurring in its vicinity.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Over time, Abernethy's political influence waned, giving way to larger centers like St. Andrews.
