While some archaeological finds date the town back to the late Viking age, the founding of Copenhagen is traditionally set in 1167, when the Danish Bishop Absalon fortified the harbor town. The well-protected harbor established Copenhagen''s importance as a center of trade and commerce for centuries to come, and it was made the capital of Denmark early in the 15th century. Unfortunately, other civilizations also noticed the natural riches of Copenhagen''s harbor, and the city was attacked numerous times, especially by the Hanseatic League (a trade organization running a monopoly along the coast of Northern Europe).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1658 the Swedes unsuccessfully tried to take the city, but in 1807 the British succeeded where they could not; a preemptive naval blockade, following by a sweeping firebombing bombardment on civilian buildings and its failing old defenses, caused massive damage to the city and left hundreds dead. After the end of the Napoleonic wars, the city began to rebuild and expand over the now useless defensive inland moats, improving sanitation and incorporating nearby towns in the process. Copenhagen was occupied by the Germans in World War II, but did not sustain any substantial damage and continued to expand greatly after the war''s end.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Copenhagen is now recognized as one of the up-and-coming cities in Europe and is ranked the "most livable city in the world" for its wonderful quality of life. The city is also renowned for its extensive public infrastructure and environmentally-friendly policies. Copenhagen is now one of the most visited cities in Europe and has become a veritable Mecca for the world''s new architects, chefs, and designers.'

SET Text = 'The ancient city of Kathmandu, capital to the highly-elevated country of Nepal, traces its history back almost 2,000 years to the dawn of the first millennium AD. Steeped in both Hindu and Buddhist traditions, the city of Kathmandu was named after a great temple found at the site known as "Kasthamandap," said to have been constructed from the timber of a single tree in the 16th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Long before the city''s establishment, the Kathmandu Valley was inhabited by the Newar people, ancestors to the modern Newars who continue to live throughout Nepal. The Newars are responsible for many of the unique characteristics that have come to be recognized as symbolic of Nepal, including the pagoda style architecture that was adapted over the centuries from both Chinese and Indian designs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During the reign of the Malla Dynasty, who ruled Kathmandu for over 500 years beginning in the 12th century, many of the city''s most notable temples and pagodas were constructed. Though the city was often fraught with conflict and turmoil, leading to the destruction of many of the earliest structures, dozens of magnificent examples remain today. In 2006, the collective of monuments within Kathmandu was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site, acknowledging the cultural significance of the historic city.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present-day, Kathmandu is home to more than one million residents, with an economy supported by the production of local crafts as well as an increasingly large tourist population. As the city continues to grow and modernize, the local government faces a difficult task in dealing with urbanization and pollution issues.'

The first King of Norway did not reside in the city until much later, sometime in the early 14th century AD, when it became officially regarded as the capital city of the country.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Unfortunately (as medieval cities were wont to do), Oslo was destroyed several times by fire in the coming centuries, and in 1624 King Christian IV ordered the city rebuilt at a new site across the bay; the city was also renamed Christiana in honor of its new founding. Christiana was a local center of commerce, but its importance declined while Norway was a part of Denmark, during which its growth slowed to a halt. After the two countries separated in 1814, Christiana grew into the largest city in Norway (overtaking Bergen), as the newly founded University of Oslo helped to fuel the population and economy. The city''s name was restored to "Oslo" in 1925.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Growth in the city has remained a source of contention, as the citizens fight both growing up (with skyscrapers) and out (destroying the local farming and fishing communities). The last century has seen a grand increase in the economy and industry of the city, and Oslo now is home to some of the world''s largest maritime shipping companies. Oslo has also recently gained the dubious honor of being the most expensive city in the world to live in, as space for apartments grows to an even higher premium.'

Taking its name from the Algonquin word "Kebec," meaning "where the river becomes narrow," the settlement of Quebec City would grow to become the center of French colonial efforts in North America throughout the 17th century.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During its early development, Quebec City served not only as a valuable trade outpost, but also as a home to various Christian missionaries and an increasing number of permanent settlers. The fur and lumber industries provided the French with valuable resources that strengthened early efforts to expand their reach in North America. Briefly passing under British rule from 1629 until 1632, the city would otherwise be controlled by the French for over 150 years, despite several sieges. In 1663, Quebec City was officially named the capital of New France, having already served as the capital of French Canada since its founding.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The French would finally lose control of the colony in 1759 to the British during the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. Britain would remain in control of Quebec City until the formation of the Dominion of Canada in 1867. Following the Constitution Act of Canada, Quebec City would become the capital of the Canadian Province of Quebec.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Today, Quebec City is home to over 500,000 residents, and continues to thrive with a rich cultural heritage. Named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1985, Quebec City still maintains much of the historic architecture from its colonial roots. Of particular interest are the famous Château Frontenac hotel, and the Roman Catholic churches of Notre-Dame de Québec and Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, both originally constructed in the 17th century.'

In time, Baekje developed from a small minor state into one of the major Three Kingdoms of Korea, a group of countries which dominated the peninsula for most of the first millennium. Over time, Seoul grew into a formidable city and held great political significance.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Eventually the Three Kingdoms were consolidated under one rule, and in 1394 AD the capital of this new country was moved to Seoul. Large walls were built around the city, as much to keep out thieves as well as tigers and other unwanted large, scary animals. Each day the gates were opened at dawn and closed at dusk, keeping the city isolated and protected. Eventually, Seoul opened its gates to the influx of westerners arriving in the east during the late 1800s, and the city began to modernize. In fact, Seoul was the first eastern city to have electricity, running water, and the telephone.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Things continued well for Seoul until World War I when the Japanese occupied Korea in 1910; the country remained under Japanese rule until 1945. After Korea''s liberation, the Republic of Korea was founded (modern day South Korea), and Seoul was named as its capital. During the Korean War, starting in 1950, Seoul changed hands between North and South Korea many times, it being less than 100 miles from the border. The city endured heavy damage during this time, with over two hundred thousand buildings in ruins.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]After the war, the city was the focus of a huge reconstruction effort and an attempt to improve the standard of living for the population, which had swelled with millions of refugees. The city continued its population and economic boom into the 21st century, becoming the third largest metropolitan area in the world and housing a full quarter of South Korea''s population. Seoul has been voted the 2010 Design Capital of the World, boasts one of the world''s most technologically advanced infrastructures, and is home to some of the world''s largest electronic companies.'

Founded by Admiral Arthur Phillip in 1788 as a penal colony, Sydney''s early development would be led initially by convicts, and later continued by retired soldiers and settlers arriving from Britain. Over time, Sydney would grow to become the largest and perhaps most famous city in Australia, with a population of over 4 million people today.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Scouted by James Cook in 1770, the original landing site, known famously as "Botany Bay", was deemed unsuitable for the location of a permanent settlement. The nearby Sydney Cove named for "Lord Sydney" Thomas Townshend, would prove to be the ideal location. This area is thought to have been inhabited by Australian Aborigines for several thousand years prior to the arrival of British colonists, and numerous tribes were found in the region upon their arrival. Despite the efforts of Admiral Phillip to regulate the interaction between colonists and the local tribesmen, thousands of Aborigines would die from smallpox and measles spread by colonial expeditions.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]During its later history, Sydney experienced a massive population boom throughout the 19th century as gold was discovered in neighboring areas, particularly Bathurst. Greatly expanding its industrial development during this period, by the 1920s, Sydney''s population would reach over 1 million and the city would continue expanding to meet its growing infrastructure needs.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In the present day, Sydney is known for its financial development, serving as the economic hub for all of Australia. Home to numerous major banks and financial institutions, the Australian Securities Exchange is also located in Sydney. Since the early 1800s, the date of Sydney''s founding, January 26th, has been celebrated as Australia''s national day, commemorating not only the city''s history, but also its importance to Australia in the present day.'

A small fortified settlement was erected at the site, both to deal with the natives and to fend off encroaching attacks from French pirates. On March 1, 1565, the city center was officially founded. The fertile land surrounding the settlement was planted with sugarcane and provided all of the city''s early income. The small city grew to about 8,000 people by 1700, but two thirds of these were probably slaves.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]About this time scouts found gold and diamonds in the neighboring hills, generating a huge influx of both wealth and immigrants. The city tripled in size and the colonial capital was transferred here in 1763. Rio continued to wildly grow and the city spilled beyond its fortified walls. Many large Romanesque aqueducts were also built at this time, the ruins of which still stand in the city. However, towards the end of the century the mines began to dry up and Central America entered the world economy with a strong sugar market of its own, both of which put Rio in a precarious position. Exports had fallen by more than half of what they were by 1796.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Coffee saved the day for Rio. In 1808 the Portuguese royal family fled to the city to escape Napoleon''s invasion of Portugal, temporarily transforming Rio into the capital of the Portuguese Empire. They ordered the growing of the bean and resettled themselves in Brazil, bringing a new-found prosperity to the colony. Expansion of the coffee plantations gave birth to a new wave of improvements in the city, and large manor homes were built, streets were paved, and fine academic institutions were founded.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]In 1822 Prince Pedro I proclaimed Brazil''s independence, and named Rio as the capital of the new empire. When the country replaced the monarchy with a republic in 1889, it kept Rio as the capital city. Rio was further transformed into a modern city through the early 1900''s as streets were widened, health conditions of its populace were improved, and the surrounding swamps were drained and reclaimed for future building sites. In 1960 the capital was moved to the newly constructed city of Brasilia, and the growth of Rio finally began to slow.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Rio de Janeiro is famous worldwide for its carnival celebrations, the invention of samba music, the Cristo Redentor (a modern Wonder of the World), and its landmark beaches. Despite challenges related to urbanization and crime, it remains one of Brazil''s most vibrant cities and a major cultural and economic hub in South America. Millions of tourists continue to visit each year to sample its charm, beauty, and relaxed spirit.'

The empire''s capital shifted westward over time to better control trade routes and defend against nomadic incursions. Bornu became a hub of Saharan commerce, exporting horses, textiles, and salt, and importing luxury goods from North Africa and beyond.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Under the reign of Idris Alooma (1571-1603), Bornu reached its greatest power, territorial extent, and prosperity. Alooma was a skilled statesman and military strategist who reformed the army, improved administration, and introduced new agricultural practices.

Bunkeya became a strategic center of commerce, trading ivory, copper, iron ore, salt, and slaves to Arab-Swahili merchants on the coast.
