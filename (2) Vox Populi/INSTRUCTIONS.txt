-- INSTRUCTIONS --

Vox Populi cannot be used without the (1) Community Patch mod.

If you installed the EUI version of the mod, you must enable (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files or Vox Populi will not function.


-- MANUAL INSTALLATION NOTE --

To manually install the non-EUI version of Vox Populi:
1) Copy this folder and "(1) Community Patch" to your MODS folder.
2) Copy the folder "VPUI" to Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC.


If you want to install the EUI version of Vox Populi, refer to the installation instructions in "(3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files."


-- CITY-STATE AUDIO CLIPS --
When manually installing VP, if you want the newly-added City-States to use the correct audio clips, you will need to move the MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml file and the Expansion2.CivPkg file.
This also fixes a BNW bug where Cape Town uses Almaty's audio clip.

1. Move the MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml file in the repository's main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2\Sounds\XML.
2. Move the Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg file in the repository's main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2.
3. Delete the existing Expansion2.Civ5Pkg file in that directory, and then rename Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg to Expansion2.Civ5Pkg.

Unfortunately, there is no way to modify the MinorCivsSounds table within a mod. It needs to be done by modifying the base game files.
