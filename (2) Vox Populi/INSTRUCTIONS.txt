-- INSTRUCTIONS --

Vox Populi cannot be used without the (1) Community Patch mod.

If you installed the EUI version of the mod, you must enable (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files or Vox Populi will not function.


-- MANUAL INSTALLATION NOTE --

Make sure to DELETE the LUA folder in the (1) Community Patch folder.

If you want to play with EUI, you must also download the (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files folder.


-- CITY-STATE AUDIO CLIPS --
When manually installing VP, if you want the newly-added City-States to use the correct audio clips, you will need to move the MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml file and the Expansion2.CivPkg file.
This also fixes a BNW bug where Cape Town uses Almaty's audio clip.

1. Move the MinorCivSounds_VoxPopuli.xml file in the repository's main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2\Sounds\XML.
2. Move the Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg file in the repository's main directory to Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2.
3. Delete the existing Expansion2.Civ5Pkg file in that directory, and then rename Expansion2_VoxPopuli.Civ5Pkg to Expansion2.Civ5Pkg.

Unfortunately, there is no way to modify the MinorCivsSounds table within a mod. It needs to be done by modifying the base game files.
