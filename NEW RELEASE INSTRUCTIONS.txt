[Instructions to Create New Release]

I, Recursive, leave these instructions on the proper method to create a new release, in case I perish or am otherwise unable to create new releases.

PREREQUISITES
- CivFanatics Account
- Collaborator permissions on the repository
- Installed Inno Script Studio and Inno Setup Compiler
- Installed ModBuddy
- Installed Python with integration into PATH
- Installed all the tools required to build the DLL
- Installed a Git editor, such as GitHub Desktop
- Cloned local copy of the repository

Make sure to merge necessary changes and test your changes to the database and DLL before creating a new release.

The version number format is "X.Y.Z"
WHERE 
X = major version number,
Y = savegame incompatible release,
Z = savegame compatible release



Note: Steps 1 through 12 can be done automatically by running "py scripts/release.py {version-number}"


[STEP 1]
Make sure you're on the latest master branch.



[STEP 2]
Create a folder somewhere on your computer named "Debug", with two blank folders inside it: "43 Civ" and "Standard".



[STEP 3]
If the new release is savegame incompatible:
- Increment the .civ5proj version number of (1) Community Patch by one.
- Increment the .civ5proj minimum savegame compatible version of (1) Community Patch by one.
- For (2), (3a), (3b), and (4a), increment the .civ5proj file's minimum version of the Community Patch (required as a dependency) by 1.
- Increment the version numbers at the beginning of the CvGameCoreDLL_Expansion2/CustomMods.h file by 1.



[STEP 4]
A. Change the displayed version number on the teasers for the following mods:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch
- (4a) Squads for VP


B. Change the current version number of bug_report_v5 in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE to match the new version number.


C. Change MyAppVersion in VPSetupData.iss to match the new version number.

Tip: Notepad++'s Find in Files feature can be useful for this step, but it will not update ISSUE_TEMPLATE.
Find what: {Old Version Number}
Replace with: {New Version Number}
Filters: *.iss *.civ5proj
Directory: GitHub\Community-Patch-DLL



[STEP 5]
Create a commit for the new release, and tag it as shown below. DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB yet.
Commit Name: "{Version Number} Release"
Tag Name: "Release-{Version Number}"

IMPORTANT: Use an annotated tag (not lightweight):
Command: git tag -a Release-{Version Number} -m "{Version Number} Release"

Verify the tag was created correctly:
Command: git describe --tags HEAD
Expected Output: Release-{Version Number}

Tip #1: This step is necessary to ensure the GameCoreDLL has the correct release identifier, which can be compared later when debugging.
Tip #2: Annotated tags include metadata (tagger, date, message) and are recommended for releases.

IMPORTANT: After building (Step 6), minidump filenames will include the full commit hash due to 
git describe --long being used in update_commit_id.bat. This is expected behavior.
Example: CvMiniDump_20260111_143025_5.1-0-gb44ce57d_Release.dmp
The "-0-gb44ce57d" means 0 commits after Release-5.1 tag, at commit b44ce57d.
This ensures every minidump is traceable to an exact commit, even for official releases.


[STEP 6]
A. Build the CvGameCore_Expansion2.dll file using the Release config (instructions are on the main repository page).


B. Place the compiled DLL and PDB files in the "(1) Community Patch" folder, replacing the existing files there.


C. Open Command Prompt and run the following commands. Leave the window open once you're done.
cd {folder path for Community-Patch-DLL}
py build_vp_clang.py --config debug


D. Go to the clang-output/Debug folder. Cut and paste the compiled DLL and PDB files into the "Standard" folder you created earlier.


E. Delete the clang-output and clang-build folders in the repository.



[STEP 7]
A. Build the 43 Civ version of the game core using the Release config: Uncomment "#define MAX_MAJOR_CIVS (43)" in CvGameCoreDLLUtil/include/CustomModsGlobal.h, amend the release commit to include the changed file, then build normally.


B. Place the compiled 43 Civ DLL in the "(3b) 43 Civs Community Patch" folder, replacing the existing files there.


C. Using your opened Command Prompt window, run the following command. Close the window when you're done.
py build_vp_clang.py --config debug


D. Go to the clang-output/Debug folder. Cut and paste the compiled DLL into the "43 Civ" folder you created earlier.


E. Compress the Debug folder into a .zip file, then delete the unzipped folder.


F. Delete the clang-output and clang-build folders in the repository.



[STEP 8]
Delete the "Release-{Version Number}" tag you've added to the new release commit, and undo the commit.
Command: git tag -d Release-{Version Number}
Command: git reset --soft HEAD~1
Revert the change to CustomModsGlobal.h from the previous step.



[STEP 9]
A. Build the following mods in ModBuddy:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch
- (4a) Squads for VP

NOTE: The autoinstaller will use the versions from the Build folder in the main directory. ModBuddy will also create a copy in your MODS folder, which you can delete.



[STEP 10]
Copy the newly compiled .modinfo files for the following mods from Build to the mods' individual folders in the main folder:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch
- (4a) Squads for VP



[STEP 11]
If you've done everything correctly, you can open the VPSetupData.iss file and hit "Compile". When it finishes, the compiled autoinstaller will be located in the "Output" subfolder.



[STEP 12]
Create a commit for the new release, and tag it as shown below.
Commit Name: "{Version Number} Release"
Tag Name: "Release-{Version Number}"

IMPORTANT: Use an annotated tag (not lightweight):
Command: git tag -a Release-{Version Number} -m "{Version Number} Release"

Verify the tag was created correctly:
Command: git describe --tags HEAD
Expected Output: Release-{Version Number}

Note: The version string used in minidumps and logs will show "Release-{Version Number}-0-g{commit}" 
format due to git describe --long. This is correct and ensures precise version tracking.



[STEP 13]
Push the release commit AND tag to GitHub.
Command: git push origin master
Command: git push origin Release-{Version Number}

IMPORTANT: The tag MUST be pushed explicitly for other developers and the build system to see it.

Verify the tag is on GitHub:
Command: git ls-remote --tags origin | grep Release-{Version Number}



[STEP 14]
A. Go to Releases on GitHub and draft a new release. Upload the compiled autoinstaller and zipped Debug folder to the release binaries.


B. For the Release title, type in "Version {Version Number}".


C. Choose the tag for the new version from the list, and then hit "Generate release notes" above the "Describe this release" text box.


D. Change the text in the box as follows:


**Release Notes Thread:**

**GitHub Changes Summary:** <Insert the link next to "Full Changelog" here>

## Pull Requests Summary
<Insert pull requests list>

<Leave anything else that was added as part of the auto-generated notes at the end>


E. Make sure "Set as a pre-release" is unchecked, and "Set as the latest release" is checked.


F. Publish the release.



[STEP 15]
IF NOT SAVEGAME COMPATIBLE: Make a new version thread on CivFanatics, including the changelog.

IF SAVEGAME COMPATIBLE: Edit the existing release thread on CivFanatics. Edit the title, add the changelog to the OP, and also make a new post in the thread (including the changelog) to alert everyone.

Link to, or update the existing link for, the compiled autoinstaller on the new release's page on GitHub.

After making the thread, copy and paste the forum thread link next to "**Release Notes Thread:**" in the text box from the previous step, and update the release.



[STEP 16]
Announce the new version on Vox Populi's Discord server. If the new release is NOT savegame compatible, ping @everyone in your announcement.
