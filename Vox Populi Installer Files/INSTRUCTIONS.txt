[VP Autoinstaller Creation Instructions]

Prerequisites: You must install Inno Script Studio and Inno Setup Compiler.

Tip: You may wish to create the autoinstaller in a *COPY* of your repository folder, since ModBuddy will create junk files.


1. Copy the following folders from the repository and place them in this folder:
- (4a) Promotion Icons for VP
- (4b) UI - Promotion Tree for VP


2a. Build the CvGameCore_Expansion2.dll file (instructions are on the main repository page).

2b. Place the compiled DLL file in the Community Patch mod's folder, replacing the existing DLL there.


3a. Build the 43 Civ version of the game core (uncomment "#define MAX_MAJOR_CIVS (43)" in CvGameCoreDLLUtil/include/CustomModsGlobal.h, then build normally).

3b. Place the compiled 43 Civ DLL file in the "(3b) 43 Civs Community Patch" folder, replacing the existing DLL there.


4a. Build the following mods in ModBuddy:
- (1) Community Patch
- (2) Vox Populi
- (3a) VP - EUI Compatibility Files
- (3b) 43 Civs Community Patch

4b. Copy the compiled mods from your MODS folder and place them in this folder.

4c. Remove the version numbers at the end of the mod folder names.


5. Cut and paste the LUA folder in the (1) Community Patch mod into the "LUA for (1) CP" folder.


6. Cut and paste the LUA folder in the (2) Vox Populi mod into the "LUA for (2) VP" folder.


6. If you've done everything correctly, you can open the CPPSetupData.iss file and hit "Compile". When it finishes, the compiled autoinstaller will be located in the "Output" subfolder.
