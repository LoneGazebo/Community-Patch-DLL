This does not mean that such a person denounces or waives their nationality or other, more local identities, but such identities are given ''second place'' to their membership in a global community. Extended, the idea leads to questions about the state of global society in the age of globalization. In general usage, the term may have much the same meaning as ''world citizen'' or cosmopolitan, but it also has additional, specialized meanings in differing contexts. Various organizations, such as the World Service Authority, have advocated global citizenship.'
