The liburnian design was adopted by the Romans and became a key part of Ancient Rome''s navy by the 2nd half of the 1st century BC. Liburnians played a key role in the battle of Actium in Greece, which saw the establishment of Augustus as the undisputed ruler of the Roman world.[NEWLINE]Liburnians were different from the battle triremes, quadriremes and quinqueremes not because of rowing but rather because of its specific constructional features.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once the Romans had adopted the liburnian, they proceeded to make a few adaptations to improve the ships’ use within the navy. The benefits gained from the addition of rams and protection from missiles more than made-up for the slight loss of speed. Besides the construction, the ships required that the regular Roman military unit be simplified in order to function more smoothly. Each ship operated as an individual entity, so the more complicated organization normally used was not necessary. Within the navy, there were probably liburnian of several varying sizes, all put to specific tasks such as scouting and patrolling Roman waters against piracy. The Romans made use of the liburnian particularly within the provinces of the empire, where the ships formed the bulk of the fleets.[NEWLINE]Gradually liburnians became a general name for the different types of the Roman ships, attached also to cargo ships in Late Antiquity.
