			<Text>[COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Monopolies[ENDCOLOR] are one of the new gameplay elements added by the Community Balance Patch.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Luxury Global Monopolies[ENDCOLOR]: the essence of the Monopoly system is expansion: as your empire expands throughout the game (either through combat or settlement), be on the lookout for Luxury resources that you already have copies of. AS you collect more and more copies of the same Luxury Resources, the percentage of global resources you control goes up. If this value goes over 50% (i.e. you control more than 50% of the world's supply of any resource), you gain a Global Monopoly over that Resource. Each Global Monopoly has a unique bonus - some grant additional yields to your tiles, whereas others boost City yields by a set percentage (see the Resource section of the Civilopedia for details).[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Strategic Global Monopolies[ENDCOLOR]: Strategic Resources operate the same way as Luxury Resources with regards to Monpolies, with one major exception. Due to the vast abundance of these resources, a true 50% Monopoly can be quite difficult. As a result, Strategic Resources have two tiers: 'Strategic' Monopolies and 'True' Monopolies. Strategic Monopolies occur at 25%, and generate special combat bonuses (such as increased health regeneration or increase defense). True Monopolies occur at 50% and, like Luxury Monopolies, they generate bonuses to City and/or tile yields.</Text>

They can have a great impact on your empire's economic development, especially in the later part of a game.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Founding Corporations[ENDCOLOR]: There are seven distinct Corporations in the game, each of which becomes available once you have researched the Corporations Technology during the Modern Age. Each Corporation has a specific set of Resource Monopolies that it relies upon - if you do not have at least one of these Resource Monopolies, you will not be able to found the Corporation. Once these two requirements are met, you need to construct the 'Headquarters' of the Corporation in one of your Cities. These buildings are World Wonders, so only one player in the world may found each Corporation! Furthermore, once you have founded a Corporation, you cannot found another one, so make sure you like the one you pick![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Building Corporate Offices[ENDCOLOR]: Once you have founded your Corporation, you can begin establishing Corporate Offices in each of your Cities. These buildings come with special bonuses similar to your Corporation's Headquarters, and are thus worthwhile to construct on their own. Most bonuses from Corporations scale with the number of Cities you own, so larger empires benefit greatly from founding a Corporation and building as many Offices as possible!</Text>

If your City has a Corporate Office, and you send a Trade Route from that City to a foreign City, a Corporate 'Franchise' will be built in that foreign City when the Trade Route completes.

For every 'Franchise' of your Corporation in a foreign City, your Corporate Offices gain unique bonuses, be it additional City yields, free resources, or improved Trade Route yields. Furthermore, many Corporations gain additional bonuses if you send Trade Routes to foreign Cities that already have your Corporation in them. Make sure to study the details of your Corporation once you have founded it so that you can maximize your benefit![NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Managing your Corporation[ENDCOLOR]: As your Corporation grows, it can be hard to keep up with where you have Franchises, and where you have Offices. Never fear! In the Economic Overview panel, you can find detailed information on your Corporation in the bottom-left corner. There, you can see the total number of Offices and Corporations you currently control, as well as drop-down lists of the locations of all Corporate Offices and Franchises, as well as the size of foreign Corporations. In addition to these elements, you can also find information about your Corporation while choosing a destination for your Trade Routes. Each City with a Franchise in it is clearly indicated.</Text>

			<Text>The word "corporation" derives from corpus, the Latin word for body, or a body of people. By the time of Justinian (reigned 527–565), Roman Law recognized a range of corporate entities under the names universitas, corpus or collegium. These included the state itself (the populus Romanus), municipalities, and such private associations as sponsors of a religious cult, burial clubs, political groups, and guilds of craftsmen or traders. Such bodies commonly had the right to own property and make contracts, to receive gifts and legacies, to sue and be sued, and, in general, to perform legal acts through representatives. Private associations were granted designated privileges and liberties by the emperor.</Text>

			<Text>Transnationalism as an economic process involves the global reorganization of the production process, in which various stages of the production of any product can occur in various countries, typically with the aim of minimizing costs. Economic transnationalism, commonly known as Globalization, was spurred in the latter half of the 20th century by the development of the internet and wireless communication, as well as the reduction in global transportation costs caused by containerization. Multinational corporations could be seen as a form of transnationalism, in that they seek to minimize costs, and hence maximize profits, by organizing their operations in the most efficient means possible irrespective of political boundaries.</Text>

			<Text>National syndicalism is an adaptation of syndicalism to suit the social agenda of integral nationalism. National syndicalism suggests that the people must defend themselves through the development of Syndicalist sections into massive economic worker movements. These should take immediate action to expropriate the capitalists. These should also take direct action to let the workers lead the production and to form peoples communes. National syndicalism seeks out principled reasons for direct economic action and denounces parliamentary action by representatives. The goal is not to make capitalism bearable, but the realisation of a free Nationalist and Socialist nation. National syndicalism aims to move the attention from the political terrain to the economic terrain. It wants the socialisation from the basis: a system of distribution from local units, in consultation with the National federation, on the fundament of a production and consumption statistic. As well as the organisation of the production by national industrial federations.</Text>

Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration. Corporations come in many different types but are usually divided by the law of the jurisdiction where they are chartered into two kinds: by whether or not they can issue stock, or by whether or not they are for profit.</Text>
