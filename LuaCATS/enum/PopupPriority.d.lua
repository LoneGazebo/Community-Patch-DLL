--- Unlike most other enums, this one doesn't come from the game core DLL<br>
--- We'll have to trust modiki on the values of these<br>
--- This seems to determine which context goes on top. Higher number will be on top of lower number.<br>
--- Some priorities are unused.<br>
--- `eUtmost` is the highest priority used to force a context to the front of the screen. Use sparingly.
