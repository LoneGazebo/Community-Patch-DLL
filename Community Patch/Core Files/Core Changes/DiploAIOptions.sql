-- Diplomacy AI Options
-- All of these options are savegame compatible (enabling/disabling them and then loading a saved game will activate/deactivate them with no issues).

-- [DISABLE VICTORY COMPETITION]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations will not receive any aggression boosts or reductions towards other players based on their victory progress.
-- Also, you will not receive any diplomacy penalties for victory competition with the AI.
-- This ONLY affects aggression changes that are caused by victory competition.
-- Conquering the world or gaining cultural Influence over the AI, for example, can still result in aggression because you pose a threat to them OR because you're simply in their way.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_DISABLE_VICTORY_COMPETITION', '0';

-- [DISABLE ENDGAME AGGRESSION BOOST]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations will not receive the large late-game aggression boost towards players that are close to victory.
-- Bonuses/penalties for general victory competition will continue to apply.
-- NOTE: If Victory Competition is disabled, this does nothing.
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_DISABLE_ENDGAME_AGGRESSION', '0';

-- If set to 1, Gandhi (if he has nukes, and Random Personalities isn't enabled) will do what he's best known for in the Civilization series. ;)
INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_ENABLE_NUCLEAR_GANDHI', '1';

-- [DISABLE INSULT MESSAGES]
-- If set to 1, AI civilizations will not send threats/insults such as "you're a warmonger" or "you're getting too friendly with our City-State friends" to human players.

INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_SHOW_ALL_OPINION_MODIFIERS', '0';

INSERT INTO Defines (Name, Value)
SELECT 'DIPLOAI_SHOW_ALL_OPINION_VALUES', '0';

-- [SHOW BASE HUMAN OPINION]
-- If set to 1, a modifier explaining the AI's instinctive like/dislike of human players will be displayed in their table of opinion modifiers.
-- This value is otherwise hidden unless Show All Opinion Modifiers, Transparent Diplomacy or Debug Mode are enabled.
-- Only does anything if AI Opinion score towards humans has been modified via OPINION_WEIGHT_BASE_HUMAN in DiploOpinionWeights.sql or AttitudeChange in DifficultyMod.xml.
