	<!-- 
					MODDERS: READ CAREFULLY!
	There are four major tables here, and then sub-tables below that:
	1.) Events - this is the main table for Player-level events.
		This handles the prerequsities and limiters of all events you create.
	2.) EventChoices - this is the main table for Player-level event choices. 
		All choices must have a parent event, and all choices alter player-level things only.
	3.) CityEvents - this is the main table for City-level events. 
		This handles the prerequisites and limites of all city events you create.
	4.) CityEventChoices - this is the main table for City-level event choices. 
		All choices must have a parent city event, and all choices alter city-level things only.
	
	Rules: 
	
	1.) Do NOT mix Player and City level events in the XML. They don't interact. The exception to this rule is with linked events, which are discussed in (9) below.
	2.) Make sure that every event choice has a parent event.
	3.) All event choices have a 'duration' - this is required to create cooldowns between the same event firing a second+ time. 
		If you want the effects of an event to wear off after the event's duration, set 'Expires' to true.
	4.) The only choice elements that can expire are as follows:
		Player-level:
			Promotions
			BuildingClasses
			Policies
			Resources
			Happiness
			City Yield Changes
			BuildingClass Yield Changes
		City-level:
			BuildingClasses
			Happiness
			City Yield Changes
			BuildingClass Yield Changes
	5.) If you are creating a multi-choice event, make sure that all Events and Event Choices have both Help and Description elements set.
	6.) If you are creating a single-choice (i.e. a pure event), you only need to set Help and Description for the Choice (not the base Event).
	7.) Make sure to set the NumChoices element for each event - 1 for single-choice events, 2+ for multi-choice events.
	8.) Player and City level events can interact, though only through a 'chaining' system using the EventLinkertables below.
		If you assign a City Event, for example, a linker value, the event will only fire if the player has had the player level event (i.e. the event's duration cooldown is still active).
		Using this, you can chain events and event choices off of each other, though (for the sake of performance) you can only assign one of each of these values to each event/choice.
		There are also options for 'no' event (i.e. two events can't be active at the same time) and 'otherplayer' (i.e. an event can only fire if another player has an event/choice active).
	9.) Events and choices can be given the 'one-shot' status, meaning that, once the event/choice has fired or is taken by the player/city, it will never happen again for the player or that city. 
		Duration can still be used to affect expiration of effects, but the event will never happen again (or the choice will never appear in a choice list again).

	<!-- Note on Era and Gamespeed Scaling: 
	
		Era scaling of values works off of the following function:
			Value x Era # = Scaled value.
			Ancient = 0 (raised to 1 a minimum), Classical = 1, Medieval = 2, Reniassance = 3, Industrial = 4, Modern = 5, Atomic = 6, Information = 7
			Example: 10 gold scaled in Medieval = 30 gold.
		Gamespeed uses a set value in the GameSpeeds table. Normally they are as follows:
			Epic = 2x
			Marathon = 3x
			Example: 10 Gold on Standard = 30 Gold on Marathon
		
		CRITICAL: Notification and Event Choice Help text are capable of scaling along with the game's era and speed automatically, if you use the following variables:

		Player Choice Help Text:
			{1_YieldCost}
			{2_InstantYield}
			{3_CityYieldGlobal}
			{4_Turns}
	
		City Choice Help Text:
			{1_YieldCost}
			{2_InstantYield}
			{3_CityYield}
			{4_GPChange}
			{5_Turns}
	
		EventChoiceNotifications (see two tables below) also have access to this:
			Player Choices:
				{4_EventChoiceScalingHelper}
			City Choices:
				{5_EventChoiceScalingHelper}
		
				These Notification Helpers grab the following scaling core information about the event:
					Player:
						Event Cost
						Event Instant Yield
						City Yield Change
						Event Duration
		
					Cities:
						Event Cost
						Event Instant Yield
						City Yield Change
						GPP Change
						Event Duration
		
		These elements are grabbed because they scale with era or gamespeed, and are thus variable. 
		ALL Help files are funneled through this, and Yields that can scale will be handled as they are above. 
		
		See the text files for my events to give you an idea of how this works!
		
		!!!! NOTE: You can ignore all of this and write them manually, but using the variables above scales costs/yields/durations. !!!!
