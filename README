Started in 2014, Vox Populi (formerly known as the "Community Balance Patch") is a collaborative effort to improve Civilization V's AI and gameplay. It consists of a collection of mods (see below) that are designed to work together seamlessly.

The core of the project, the Community Patch, is a DLL-based mod that can be used independently of all other mods in the Project in order to improve your Civilization V experience. It does not modify any of the core game's content (such as leaders or buildings), but improves AI performance and addresses a number of bugs that remained after the final Civilization V patch.

The Community Balance Overhaul (and all other elements of the Project), however, expands and changes the core mechanics of the game, offering an entirely new Civilization V experience that feels and plays like an evolution of the series. 

What are the requirements?

    Civilization V (Version 1.0.3.279)
    Gods and Kings Expansion
    Brave New World Expansion
    All Leader DLC
    Ancient Wonders DLC
